                        Hello friends and family! We are so excited to celebrate with you all in Alnwick.

                        In the spirit of DIY and saving money, Matt has watched several YouTube videos and put together this website to share all the key information about the event. He would appreciate if you could endorse his "Web Developer" skill on LinkedIn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will be arriving in Alnwick on Wednesday (14/08) to set things up and leaving on Sunday (18/08) for a dreamy 2 week honeymoon in Greece. We recommend everyone arrives at some point on Thursday in time to join us for the <a href="#event" class="page-scroll">Welcome Party</a>. It would be great to see you at the <a href="#BBQ-event" class="page-scroll">Recovery BBQ</a> on Saturday.

                        The pub does not serve food so please arrange to eat before or after. The venue is small, so depending on numbers and if it gets very busy with all of us plus locals and other patrons, then we may need to move onto a second venue. If that happens, plan B is to head down the road to the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/HfopAoip74fYStxKA"> Fleece </a>.

                        Be warned (particularly those from the southern hemisphere): while it is August, there is still a strong possibility it will be grey and cold so please plan accordingly (and hope for sunshine and warm weather!)<br>

                    <dd> We kindly request everyone to leave your phone in your pockets for the duration of our ceremony and key parts of the reception. We have a great photographer ready to capture these moments for all of us and would rather everyone was truly present and focussed on enjoying the celebrations. We will make time for you to take photos with us at various points throughout the day. This will make our photographer's life much easier so that he doesn't need to photoshop your phone out of his shots!
                        <br><br>
                        The Treehouse and main gardens are separated by a short walk (less than 5 mins). The Treehouse will be closed to the public for the duration of our ceremony until around 4pm but the gardens will remain open to the public until around 6pm. Both spaces are well equipped for any wet weather.<br>
                        <br>
                    The venue is a short walk from the main town. Please let us know if you think you will need a taxi as it is best to pre-book. Parking is available at the Treehouse, just mention that you are attending our wedding and the attendant will let you in.<br><br>
                    Please eat a big breakfast. There will be canapes after the ceremony but the main food won't be served until around 4.30pm.
                    <br><br>
                    We will be providing some drinks throughout the day and with the main meal. At other times there will be a bar operating like a normal venue.
                    <br><br>
                    There is no smoking in the Treehouse. Please make your way to the car park to light up. There is a designated smoking area in the gardens.

                        We are planning a casual gathering on the Saturday afternoon to bring everyone together again and reflect on what will surely have been an amazing day. We ware hoping for glorious sunshine to host an outdoor BBQ, but as we are in the UK, the event will be weather dependent, with an alternative option to be worked out closer to the time.

            <p>Alnwick is a very pretty market town roughly halfway between Newcastle and the Scottish border. </p>
            <h3>Getting There </h3>
            <p>
                We recommend using public transport to travel to and from Alnwick. The closest train station is Alnmouth. There are regular, direct trains from London Kings Cross that take approximately 3 and a half hours (quite impressive when you consider it is around 500km). The best time to buy tickets is roughly 8-12 weeks from when you would like to travel. We use <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com/">trainline</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                From Alnmouth it is a short taxi (10 minutes) into Alnwick. There is also a bus that runs every half an hour that takes 20 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                We suggest hiring a car if you would like to explore more of Northumberland. This is probably best done from Newcastle-upon-Tyne as this is the closest major city.
            </p>

            <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
            <p>
                Below is a list of recommendations for reasonably priced places to stay in Alnwick. The wedding will be during UK school holidays so we suggest securing accommodation soon.

However, just to let you know, we had quite a few challenges securing our own accommodation through these platforms because many of the options required a minimum amount of nights or to check in and out on specific days of the week that did not align with our dates.

            <h3>Local Highlights</h3>
            <p>The Northumberland region is known for its deep history and natural beauty. Amy and her Mam have put together a great list of local highlights for everyone traveling to the region for the first time. For those wondering, "Mam" is not a spelling error. It is the <a href="http://dialectblog.com/2011/04/07/mom-mum-mam/">northern dialect</a> way of spelling "mum".</p>
            <p> Alnwick itself is a beautiful English countryside town with nice walks on its doorstep. The castle is the biggest attraction thanks to it being an inspiration for the Hogwarts school in Harry Potter. Another notable mention is Barter Books, one of the oldest libraries in Northern England, set inside an old train station.  </p>
            <p><strong>Northumberland coast AONB </strong></p>
            <p>Full of spectacular English Heritage castles and long stretches of sandy beaches (swimming definitely only for the brave even if it will be peak Summer...) </p>
            <p> Worth a drive starting south at the small market town of Warkworth (be sure to check out the first castle) and travelling northwards along the coast road through Alnmouth, Craster, stopping at Dunstunborough Castle (14th century castle standing  a remote headland)  followed by Bamburgh Castle. Whilst Bamburgh is pretty iconic, it’s also very popular so we recommend going a bit further north to Ross Sands which has spectacular views of Bamburgh Castle and also Lindisfarne Castle on Holy Island.  </p>

            <p><strong>Hadrians Wall</strong></p>
<p>It seems only fitting to mention Hadrians Wall here (also known as the Roman Wall) – a UNESCO world heritage site over 1900 years old. Whilst it spans 73 miles across northern England, we recommend starting at Housesteads Roman Fort, following the wall to Sycamore Gap, which sadly if you have read the news recently, will have learned that the famous tree no longer stands. The drone video at the top of the page is Matt's from when we did this walk last summer. </p>

<p><strong>Ford and Etal</strong></p>
<p>Recommended day trip from Amy’s mam. Mix of coastline and countryside.</p>

<p>Drive from Alnwick to Chillingham Castle, supposedly the most haunted castle in the UK. Head west to the town of Wooler and then on to Branxton Moor – site of the Battle of Flodden. Continue on towards the pretty village of Ford (also with a castle). Drive north to the next village of Etal (not missing yet another castle) and be sure to check out the old Black Bull thatched pub. Take the BS354 towards Berwick, cutting through the country lanes to Norham and its spectacular looking castle. Head NE to Berwick-upon-Tweed - a very scenic historic town and a gateway to the Scottish border.</p>

<p><strong>Hexham and Corbridge</strong></p>
<p>Two pretty riverside market towns about an hours drive south of Alnwick. If you have time, take the scenic route back along the old Corn Road, past Wallington Hall (a National Trust property), over the rugged moors to Rothbury (another pretty market town), then on towards Cragside, an impressive historic house with extensive grounds open to the public. The head back to Alnwick via Edlingham Castle.</p>

<p><strong>Newcastle-upon-Tyne</strong></p>
<p>Birthplace of the bride and definitely worth going to if you have time. Ask any of the ‘Geordies’ at the wedding for some top recommendations. Matt highly recommends a trip to St James' Park on matchday.</p>

        <p>
            We are extremely grateful for the effort you are making to celebrate with us. We are not setting up a traditional registry and consider your presence at our wedding as a gift in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do feel like gifting us something, we would appreciate a contribution towards our honeymoon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Or if you would prefer to get us a physical present that we will associate with the occasion and your generosity, we have made a small list of items that will help us start our lives together as husband and wife on our return to Sydney (hint, one of our ideas has four legs and rhymes with log). Given that we are moving not long after our wedding, for practical reasons we suggest that these are ordered later in the year. Rather than share the list here, please let us know if this is something you would like and we will get in touch.

            <p>
                It all started while Amy was in Australia living the stereotypical life of a British backpacker. After working for three months in rural Queensland to satisfy the Australian government she was worthy of another year in the country, she settled into a relatively care-free life in Sydney. It was in her last six months before her scheduled deportation that she began working at PSM with Matt where he regarded himself as the golden boy, up and coming geotechnical engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                From there it was actually quite a slow burner. It wasn't love at first sight as many may have predicted. Matt thought Amy was too tall for him. Amy wasn't all that interested to begin with, but thought he was funny and enjoyed his company at morning tea on the cool kids table. After an eventful work conference in Wollongong (yes - this is a real place for those reading this from the UK), we started dating.
            <p>
                Matt officially asked Amy to be his girlfriend at Bilgola Beach on a beautiful sunny Saturday in late September. It took Amy a while to tell her Mam that she had an Aussie boyfriend, and once she did, Matt knew this was the real deal. Amy proceeded to bribe the Australian government for a student visa to stay in the country for another 12 months.
            </p>
                Amy briefly returned to the UK for around two months to spend some much needed quality time with friends and family. She arrived just in time to get trapped in the infamous "Beast from the East" storm which gave her plenty of opportunity to re-watch all of Gilmore Girls. Eventually it was time to say goodbye to the British winter and reunite with Matt for our first big holiday together in the Philippines. This was a magical experience and really kick started our adventurous spirit. As you all know, we have since travelled together almost non-stop, sharing memorable experiences that have shaped who we are as a couple.
            </p>
            <p>
                We lived together in Sydney in a tiny studio apartment. The bed was the couch, the bathroom was literally in a cupboard and Matt got stuck in the run-down lift on the way to work one day. Despite all its faults, the space was lovely and perfect for us. There was nowhere to hide and we really got to know each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Amy's student visa was going to expire, we were faced with a difficult decision. At this point we decided to pack up and try our luck in London. It is fair to say that in the beginning Matt had a rough time adjusting to life in the UK. We would go weeks without feeling the sun on our skin, the nearest beach was 2 hours away and people thought he was weird for using a gas bbq. All challenges aside, it turned out to be a really positive move as we both settled into great jobs, were able to develop lifelong friendships with amazing people in London and Matt was able to connect with Amy's family.
            </p>
            <p>
                After five years in London, the next chapter of our lives will see us move back to Sydney as husband and wife. We look excitedly towards the future and will make sure to fully enjoy our remaining time in the UK.

                    <dt>Matt's version</dt>
                    <dd>"It was coming up to our five year anniversary and I knew that this was going to be the time to propose. We were both super excited to get out of London and into the French countryside. I just needed a ring.<br><br>
                        With the help of one of my brother's friends, I got in touch with a bespoke designer based in Hong Kong. She helped me find a beautiful diamond and create a unique ring that would be perfect for Amy. The ring was finished just in time and arrived two days before we were due to fly. I got a notification while at work that it was out for delivery. Amy was working from home that day so I told her that I'd got her an anniversary gift and please do not look at the packaging. She ended up signing for her own engagement ring!<br><br>
                        With the ring safely hidden in my camera bag we flew out of London and began our trip. I waited until the second day once we had both properly relaxed to do it. We were staying in a beautiful B&B in the countryside (see the photo below). We had got back from exploring and were sitting by the pool. I said to Amy that I'd go up to the toilet and would also grab some more sunscreen on my way down. I collected my thoughts and had a moment of realisation that this was really about to happen before I went back down with the ring (and the sunscreen).<br><br>
                        I think Amy knew something was up because all of a sudden I got quite nervous. I got onto one knee and the words I said were “I have a confession that I didn’t get you an anniversary present. I got you much more than that. I love you so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me.”<br><br>
                        At first Amy was very confused. Then she kept asking me how I organised everything. Then after a few more moments she finally said yes and the rest is history.<br><br>
