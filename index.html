                        Hello friends and family! We are so excited to celebrate with you all in Alnwick.

                    <p>
                        In the spirit of DIY and saving money, Matt has watched several YouTube videos and put together this website to share all the key information about the event. He would appreciate if you could endorse his "Web Developer" skill on Linkedin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will be arriving in Alnwick on Wednesday (14/08) to set things up and leaving on Sunday (18/08) for a dreamy 2 week honeymoon in Greece. We recommend everyone arrives at some point on Thursday in time to join us for the <a href="#event" class="page-scroll">Welcome Party</a>. It would be great to see you at the <a href="#BBQ-event" class="page-scroll">Recovery BBQ</a> on Saturday.

            <hr class="primary">
            <p>Alnwick is a very pretty market town roughly halfway between Newcastle and the Scottish border. </p>
            <h3>Getting There </h3>
            <p>
                We recommend using public transport to travel to and from Alnwick. The closest train station is Alnmouth. There are regular, direct trains from London Kings Cross that take approximately 3 and a half hours (quite impressive when you consider it is around 500km). The best time to buy tickets is roughly 8-12 weeks from when you would like to travel. We use <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com/">trainline</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                From Alnmouth it is a short taxi (10 minutes) into Alnwick. There is also a bus that runs every half an hour that takes 20 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                We suggest hiring a car if you would like to explore more of Northumberland. This is probably best done from Newcastle-upon-Tyne as this is the closest major city.
            </p>
            <hr class="primary">
            <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
            <p>
                Below is a list of recommendations for reasonably priced places to stay in Alnwick. The wedding will be during UK school holidays so we suggest securing accommodation soon.

However, just to let you know, we had quite a few challenges securing our own accommodation through these platforms because many of the options required a minimum amount of nights or to check in and out on specific days of the week that did not align with our dates.

            <h3>Local Highlights</h3>
            <p>The Northumberland region is known for its deep history and natural beauty. Amy and her Mam have put together a great list of local highlights for everyone traveling to the region for the first time. For those wondering, "Mam" is not a spelling error. It is the <a href="http://dialectblog.com/2011/04/07/mom-mum-mam/">northern dialect</a> way of spelling "mum".</p>
            <p> Alnwick itself is a beautiful English countryside town with nice walks on its doorstep. The castle is the biggest attraction thanks to it being an inspiration for the Hogwarts school in Harry Potter. Another notable mention is Barter Books, one of the oldest libraries in Northern England, set inside an old train station.  </p>
            <p><strong>Northumberland coast AONB </strong></p>
            <p>Full of spectacular English Heritage castles and long stretches of sandy beaches (swimming definitely only for the brave even if it will be peak Summer...) </p>
            <p> Worth a drive starting south at the small market town of Warkworth (be sure to check out the first castle) and travelling northwards along the coast road through Alnmouth, Craster, stopping at Dunstunborough Castle (14th century castle standing  a remote headland)  followed by Bamburgh Castle. Whilst Bamburgh is pretty iconic, it’s also very popular so we recommend going a bit further north to Ross Sands which has spectaclar views of Bamburgh Castle and also Lindisfarne Castle on Holy Island.  </p>

            <p><strong>Hadrians Wall</strong></p>
<p>It seems only fitting to mention Hadrians Wall here (also known as the Roman Wall) – a UNESCO world heritage site over 1900 years old. Whilst it spans 73 miles across northern England, we recommend starting at Housesteads Roman Fort, following the wall to Sycamore Gap, which sadly if you have read the news recently, will have learned that the famous tree no longer stands. The drone video at the top of the page is Matt's from when we did this walk last summer. </p>

<p><strong>Ford and Etal</strong></p>
<p>Recommended day trip from Amy’s mam. Mix of coastline and countryside.</p>

<p>Drive from Anlwick to Chillingham Castle, supposedly the most haunted castle in the UK. Head west to the town of Wooler and then on to Branxton Moor – site of the Battle of Flodden. Continue on towards the pretty village of Ford (also with a castle). Drive north to the next village of Etal (not missing yet another castle) and be sure to check out the old Black Bull thatched pub. Take the BS354 towards Berwick, cutting through the country lanes to Norham and its spectacular looking castle. Head NE to Berwick-upon-Tweed - a very scenic historic town and a gateway to the Scottish border.</p>

<p><strong>Hexham and Corbridge</strong></p>
<p>Two pretty riverside market towns about an hours drive south of Alnwick. If you have time, take the scenic route back along the old Corn Road, past Wallington Hall (a National Trust property), over the rugged moors to Rothbury (another pretty market town), then on towards Cragside, an impressive historic house with extensive grounds open to the public. The head back to Alnwick via Edlingham Castle.</p>

<p><strong>Newcastle-upon-Tyne</strong></p>
<p>Birthplace of the bride and definitely worth going to if you have time. Ask any of the ‘Geordies’ at the wedding for some top recommendations. Matt highly recommends a trip to St James' Park on matchday.</p>
